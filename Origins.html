	      width = 300>The piano is one of the most influential and representative of the classical instruments. When we think of a piano, the first thing that comes to mind is probably its large shape and its black and white keys. But the piano was not made by one person nor in a short period of time. The piano is actually a result from years and years of improvement of previous musical instruments. The first actual piano that was ever invented was made by Bartolomeo Cristofori of Italy in 1700. Back then, the instrument was not called the piano but the pianoforte. Cristofori had based this new instrument on previous instruments like the clavichord and the harpsichord, both having a similar shape as the piano. But what made Cristofori's pianoforte different from the previous instruments? Well, the name pianoforte tells us the answer. In Italian, piano means soft and forte means loud. What was amazing about Cristofori's instrument was that it was the first harpsichord like instrument that could play in different dynamics, hence the name pianoforte. How did Cristofori achieve this amazing feat? Prior to Cristofori's invention of the pianoforte, the harpsichord produced sound by plucking the strings like a musician does on a guitar. Cristofori invented a hammer-action which would hit the strings like a musician would do on drums. The harder one hits the strings the louder the sound. The modern piano would then on influence a plethora of composers and musicians, allowing the development of new musical styles and compositions. The development of the piano did not stop with Cristofori. Cristofori's piano was still weaker in sound compared to the modern grand piano. The wooden plates of Chistofori's piano would later be replaced with iron plates allowing a stronger resonance of the sound. The modern grand piano has an exceptionally beautiful sound but manufacturers are still looking for more ways to inprove the piano. The future of the piano is limitless.</p>
