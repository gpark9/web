     <p>Johann Sebastian Bach, one of the greatest Baroque composers</p>
	 <p>The Baroque period was the first of the four major classical music periods. Cristofori's pianoforte had just been invented and composers from that era were mostly making music for the harpsichord still. Yet the musical style from the Baroque period was totally different from the previous Renaissance period in which different modes of music were introduces. Most importantly, concepts like major and minor keys, both part of the modes in classsical music, were being developed. Most evidently, this could be seen in Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier in which Bach experimented with all the major and minor keys by writing preludes and fugues.</p>
	 <p>Famous composers from the Baroque period include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frederic Handel, and Antonio Vivaldi.</p>

	 <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest Classical period composers</p>
	 <p>The second major period of classical music is the Classical Era. During this time, there was an increase of patronage for classical composers, thus causing a accelerated change of musical style accomodated to upper class members of society. Te major difference between the Classical Era and the Baroque Era was that instead of focusing on polyphonic lines through the use of complex counterpoint in which the Baroque composers were absolutely masters at, the Classical composers more focues on a single melodic line with an accompaniment. This change would emphasize more on dynamics and phrasing, more suiting the use of the pianoforte. These changes during the Classical period would essentially go further in developing beautiful melodic lines, essentially causing the Romantic Period.

	 <p>Frederic Chopin, one of the most famous Romantic composers</p>
	 <p>Up to the Classical period of classical music, music was for the upperclass members of society and although genius composers like Mozart did present absolutely out of the box pieces, the structure of classical music was still pretty rigid. During the Romantic period of music, composers started to find ways to express their own personal feelings. THe emphasis of music was now on human emotion, not so much on the foundational structure of classical music. The Classical composer that really influenced the start of the Romantic period was Ludwig van Beethovan who experimented and broke many traditional rules of classical music. Also as the Romantic period of music was taking place during the Romanticism Movement, composers had a interest in expressing nature which can be clearly heard in many of Chopin's works.

     <p>Igor Stravinsky, one of the best Comtemporary Classical composers</p>
	 <p>Contemporary Classical music is the latest musical period. In fact, the contemporary classical period is still occuring to this day. Many classical composers are trying and experimenting new things. Many are trying to further break boundaries and explore new territories. Debussy, a fine example of a contemporary composer experimented with atonal music which succeded in producing a dreamy and mystic quality. The more modern we get, it seems classical music becoming much more abstract compared to the Baroque period musis it started out from.
