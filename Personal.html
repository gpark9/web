	 <h2>Personal Favorite Classical Pieces</h2>
	 <p>Now, I will introduce some of my favorite classical pieces. My personal favorite form of music for the piano is the piano concerto, so most of these will not be solo piano pieces. </p>
	 <h3>Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2 Op.18</h3>
	 <img src="https://wpr-public.s3.amazonaws.com/wprorg/s3fs-public/field/image/Rachmaninoff_1900.jpg" width= 200>
	 <p class="description">Sergei Rachmaninoff</p>
	 <p>Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto is absolutely my favorite piano concerto out there. Rachmaninoff's ingenius creation of extremely beautiful and mystical melodies almost sounds like something unworldly and celestial. I especially enjoy his climaxes which no other composer can outdo his grandness. Enjoy!</p>

	 <h3>Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1</h3>
	 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/JohannesBrahms.jpg" width= 200>
	 <p class="description">Johannes Brahms</p>
	 <p>Brahms' first piano concerto captures the tragic yet comforting style of Brahms. You'll understand when the piano plays its solo. Amidst the tragedy happening which is protrayed by the orchestra, the piano's solo arises like a small gleam of light in a well of darkness. Brahms' abilty to mix opposite feelings is absolutely worthy of hearing. Enjoy!</p>

	 <h3>Chopin Piano Sonata No.3 Op.58</h3>

	 <p class="description">Frederic Chopin</p>
	 <p>Chopin wrote so many great pieces for the piano but I think his last piano sonata or his third piano sonata is one of his greatest compositions. As usual, Chopin gives us an immensely beautiful melody yet for this sonata it is quite turbulent. It is undoubtly one of his masterpieces. Enjoy!</p>

	 <h3>Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5 "Emperor"</h3>
	 <img src="https://www.gramophone.co.uk/media/193368/beethoven-free-cropped_2.jpg?&width=780&quality=60" width= 200>
	 <p class="description">Ludwig van Beethoven</p>
	 <p>Beethoven wrote many piano concertoes so it was hard to pick since all of them are so good but the Emperor is one of the more famous ones of the piano concertoes. It is most notably known for its grand entrance, depicting the entrance of an emperor. What is most intersting about this piece is that is goes against much of the traditional framework of the piano concerto. Its structure is a ingenius, almost surprising compared to prior piano concertos. Enjoy!</p>

	 <h3>Liszt Transcendental Etude No.4 "Mazeppa"</h3>
	 <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/04/82304-050-242D7462/Franz-Liszt-oil-canvas-Henri-Lehmann-Carnavalet-1840.jpg" width= 200>
	 <p class="description">Franz Liszt</p>
	 <p>Probably one of the greatest piano players in classical history - Franz Liszt. Famous for his many devilishly hard compositions and his charisma for performance, Liszt wrote a lot of amazing peices. His compositions while requiring immense technical ability, his melodies are really rich and beautiful. Mazeppa was a composition based on a poem by Lord Byron about a legendary hero. Once you hear the music the feeling of heroism will be unavoidable which makes Liszt a genius in writing descriptive melodies or melodies that can create imagery. Enjoy!</p>
