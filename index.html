		   <p>Cristofori's PianoForte</p>
		   
         <p>The piano is one of the most influential and representative of the classical instruments. When we think of a piano, the first thing that comes to mind is probably its large shape and its black and white keys. But the piano was not made by one person nor in a short period of time. The piano is actually a result from years and years of improvement of previous musical instruments. The first actual piano that was ever invented was made by Bartolomeo Cristofori of Italy in 1700. Back then, the instrument was not called the piano but the pianoforte. Cristofori had based this new instrument on previous instruments like the clavichord and the harpsichord, both having a similar shape as the piano. But what made Cristofori's pianoforte different from the previous instruments? Well, the name pianoforte tells us the answer. In Italian, piano means soft and forte means loud. What was amazing about Cristofori's instrument was that it was the first harpsichord like instrument that could play in different dynamics, hence the name pianoforte. This piano would then on influence a plethroa of composers and musicians, allowing the development of new musical styles and compositions. The development of the piano did not stop with Cristofori. Cristofori's piano was still weaker in sound compared to the modern grand piano. The wooden plates of Chistofori's piano would later be replaced with iron plates allowing a stronger resonance of the sound. The modern grand piano has an exceptionally beautiful sound but manufacturers are still looking for more ways to inprove the piano. The future of the piano is limitless.

		 <h2>Classical Piano Throughout History</h2>
		 <h3>Baroque</h3>

	     <p>Johann Sebastian Bach, one of the greatest Baroque composers</p>
		 <p>The Baroque period was the first of the four major classical music periods. Cristofori's pianoforte had just been invented and composers from that era were mostly making music for the harpsichord still. Yet the musical style from the Baroque period was totally different from the previous Renaissance period in which different modes of music were introduces. Most importantly, concepts like major and minor keys, both part of the modes in classsical music, were being developed. Most evidently, this could be seen in Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier in which Bach experimented with all the major and minor keys by writing preludes and fugues.</p>
		 <p>Famous composers from the Baroque period include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frederic Handel, and Antonio Vivaldi.</p>

		 <h3>Classical</h3>

		 <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest Classical period composers</p>
		 <p>The second major period of classical music is the Classical Era. During this time, there was an increase of patronage for classical composers, thus causing a accelerated change of musical style accomodated to upper class members of society. Te major difference between the Classical Era and the Baroque Era was that instead of focusing on polyphonic lines through the use of complex counterpoint in which the Baroque composers were absolutely masters at, the Classical composers more focues on a single melodic line with an accompaniment. This change would emphasize more on dynamics and phrasing, more suiting the use of the pianoforte. These changes during the Classical period would essentially go further in developing beautiful melodic lines, essentially causing the Romantic Period.

		 <p>Famous Composers from the Classical period include Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Franz Schubert.</p>

		 <h3>Romantic</h3>

		 <p>Frederic Chopin, one of the most famous Romantic composers</p>
		 <p>Up to the Classical period of classical music, music was for the upperclass members of society and although genius composers like Mozart did present absolutely out of the box pieces, the structure of classical music was still pretty rigid. During the Romantic period of music, composers started to find ways to express their own personal feelings. THe emphasis of music was now on human emotion, not so much on the foundational structure of classical music. The Classical composer that really influenced the start of the Romantic period was Ludwig van Beethovan who experimented and broke many traditional rules of classical music. Also as the Romantic period of music was taking place during the Romanticism Movement, composers had a interest in expressing nature which can be clearly heard in many of Chopin's works.

		 <p>Some of the most famous composers during the Romantic era include Frederic Chopin, Franz Liszt, Pyotr Llyich Tchaikovsky, RObert Schumann, and Feliz Mendelssohn</p>

	     <p>Igor Stravinsky, one of the best Comtemporary Classical composers</p>
		 <p>Contemporary Classical music is the latest musical period. In fact, the contemporary classical period is still occuring to this day. Many classical composers are trying and experimenting new things. Many are trying to further break boundaries and explore new territories. Debussy, a fine example of a contemporary composer experimented with atonal music which succeded in producing a dreamy and mystic quality. The more modern we get, it seems classical music becoming much more abstract compared to the Baroque period musis it started out from.

		 <p> Some famous composers of the Comtemporary era include Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, and Arnold Schoenberg.</p>
